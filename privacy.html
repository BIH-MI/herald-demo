						<h4>Introduction and Overview</h4>
						<p>We have drafted this privacy policy (version 01.12.2021-311891618) 
						to explain to you in accordance with the requirements of the 
						<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679&amp;tid=311891618" target="_blank">General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679</a> 
						and applicable national laws, what personal data (in short, data) 
						we as controllers - and those processors commissioned by us (e.g., providers) 
						- process, will process in the future, and what lawful options you have. 
						The terms used are to be understood in a gender-neutral manner.</p>
						
						<p><b>In short:</b> We comprehensively inform you about the data we process about you.</p>
						
						<p>Privacy statements usually sound very technical and use legal jargon. 
						This privacy policy, on the other hand, is intended to describe the most 
						important things to you as simply and transparently as possible. To promote 
						transparency, technical terms are explained in a user-friendly manner, links 
						to further information are provided, and graphics are used. We therefore 
						inform in clear and simple language that we only process personal data in 
						the course of our business activities if there is a corresponding legal basis. 
						This is certainly not possible when providing as brief, unclear, and legally 
						technical explanations as are often the standard on the internet when it comes 
						to data protection. I hope you find the following explanations interesting 
						and informative, and perhaps there's some information you didn't know before.</p>
						
						<p>If you still have questions, we ask you to contact the responsible party 
						mentioned below or in the imprint, follow the existing links, and view further 
						information on third-party sites. Of course, you can also find our contact 
						details in the imprint.</p>

						<h4>Scope of Application</h4>
						<p>This privacy policy applies to all personal data processed by 
						us within the company and for all personal data processed by companies 
						(processors) commissioned by us. By personal data, we mean information 
						as defined in Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR, such as a person's name, email address,
						and postal address. Processing personal data enables us to offer and 
						bill our services and products, be it online or offline. The scope of 
						this privacy policy includes:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li>all online presences (websites, online shops) that we operate</li>
							<li>social media appearances and email communication</li>
							<li>mobile apps for smartphones and other devices</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>In short: The privacy policy applies to all areas where 
						personal data is processed structuredly within the company via the 
						mentioned channels. Should we enter into legal relations with you 
						outside of these channels, we will inform you separately, if necessary.</p>
						
						<h4>Legal Bases</h4>
						<p>In the following privacy policy, we provide you with 
						transparent information about the legal principles and regulations, that
						is, the legal bases of the General Data Protection Regulation, which 
						allow us to process personal data.</p>
						
						<p>As for EU law, we refer to the REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE 
						EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL dated 27 April 2016. Of course, 
						you can read this General Data Protection Regulation of the EU online at
						EUR-Lex, the gateway to EU law, at <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679" target="_blank">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679</a>.</p>
						
						<p>We only process your data if at least one of the following conditions applies:</p>
						
						<ol>
							<li><b>Consent</b> (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR): You have given us 
								your consent to process data for a specific purpose. An example would be
								the storage of data you entered in a contact form.</li>
							<li><b>Contract</b> (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR): To fulfill a 
								contract or pre-contractual obligations with you, we process your data. 
								For instance, if we conclude a purchase contract with you, we require 
								certain personal information beforehand.</li>
							<li><b>Legal Obligation</b> (Article 6(1)(c) GDPR): If we are 
								subject to a legal obligation, we process your data. For example, we are
								legally required to retain invoices for accounting purposes. These 
								usually contain personal data.</li>
							<li><b>Legitimate Interests</b> (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR): In the
								event of legitimate interests that do not restrict your fundamental 
								rights, we reserve the right to process personal data. For example, we 
								need to process certain data to operate our website securely and 
								economically efficiently. This processing is thus a legitimate interest.</li>
						</ol>
						
						<p>Other conditions such as public interest tasks and the exercise
						of public authority as well as the protection of vital interests 
						generally do not apply to us. If such a legal basis should nevertheless 
						be relevant, it will be indicated at the appropriate place.</p>
						
						<p>In addition to the EU regulation, national laws also apply:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li>In Austria, this is the Federal Law on the Protection of 
								Natural Persons with regard to the Processing of Personal Data (Data 
								Protection Act), abbreviated DSG.</li>
							<li>In Germany, the Federal Data Protection Act, abbreviated BDSG, applies.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>If other regional or national laws apply, we will inform you about them in the following sections.</p>

						<h4>Storage Duration</h4>
						<p>As a general criterion for us, we only store personal data for 
						as long as is absolutely necessary to provide our services and products.
						This means that we delete personal data as soon as the reason for 
						processing it no longer exists. In some cases, we are legally obliged to
						keep certain data even after the original purpose has ceased, for 
						example, for accounting purposes.</p>
						
						<p>If you wish to have your data deleted or revoke your consent to
						data processing, the data will be deleted as quickly as possible, as 
						long as there is no obligation to retain it.</p>
						
						<p>We will provide information on the specific duration of the 
						respective data processing further below, as long as we have more 
						details on that.</p>
						
						<h4>Rights according to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h4>
						<p>According to Article 13 of the GDPR, you are entitled to the following rights to ensure fair and transparent processing of data:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>According to Article 15 of the GDPR, you have the right to 
								inquire if we are processing your data. If this is the case, you are 
								entitled to receive a copy of the data and learn the following 
								information:
								<ul>
									<li>the purposes for which we process the data;</li>
									<li>the categories, meaning the types of data that are processed;</li>
									<li>who receives this data and if the data is transferred to third countries, how security can be ensured;</li>
									<li>how long the data is stored;</li>
									<li>the existence of the right to rectification, deletion, or restriction of processing and the right to object to the processing;</li>
									<li>that you can lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (links to these authorities can be found below);</li>
									<li>the source of the data if we did not collect it from you;</li>
									<li>whether profiling is conducted, meaning if data is automatically evaluated to create a personal profile about you.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>According to Article 16 of the GDPR, you have the right to rectification, meaning we must correct data if you find errors.</li>
							<li>According to Article 17 of the GDPR, you have the right to 
								deletion (or the "right to be forgotten"), which specifically means you 
								can demand the deletion of your data.</li>
							<li>According to Article 18 of the GDPR, you have the right to 
								restrict processing, meaning we can only store but not further use the 
								data.</li>
							<li>According to Article 19 of the GDPR, you have the right to 
								data portability, which means we must provide your data in a common 
								format upon request.</li>
							<li>According to Article 21 of the GDPR, you have the right to object, which, if enforced, leads to a change in the processing.
								<ul>
									<li>If the processing of your data is based on Article 
										6(1)(e) (public interest, exercise of public authority) or Article 
										6(1)(f) (legitimate interest), you can object to the processing. We will
										then promptly check whether we can legally comply with this objection.</li>
									<li>If data is used for direct advertising, you can object 
										to this type of data processing at any time. We must then no longer use 
										your data for direct marketing purposes.</li>
									<li>If data is used for profiling, you can object to this 
										type of data processing at any time. We must then no longer use your 
										data for profiling.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>In some cases, according to Article 22 of the GDPR, you have
								the right not to be subjected to a decision based solely on automated 
								processing (e.g., profiling).</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p><b>In short:</b> You have rights - do not hesitate to contact the responsible body listed above!</p>
						<p>If you believe that the processing of your data violates data 
						protection laws or your data protection rights have been violated in any
						other way, you can lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority. 
						For Austria, this is the Data Protection Authority, which you can find 
						at <a href="https://www.dsb.gv.at/" target="_blank">https://www.dsb.gv.at/</a>. In 
						Germany, each federal state has a data protection commissioner. For more
						information, you can contact the Federal Commissioner for Data 
						Protection and Freedom of Information (BfDI). The following local data 
						protection authority is responsible for our company:</p>
						
						<h4>Berlin Data Protection Authority</h4>
						<p>State Commissioner for Data Protection: Meike Kamp<br>

						<h4>Cookies</h4>
						<b>Summary of Cookies</b>
						<p>Affected: Website visitors<br>
						Purpose: Depends on the specific cookie. More details can be 
						found below or from the software manufacturer that sets the cookie.<br>
						Processed data: Depends on the cookie in use. More details can
						be found below or from the software manufacturer that sets the cookie.<br>
						Storage duration: Depends on the specific cookie, ranging from hours to years.<br>
						Legal bases: Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Art. 6 para. 1 lit.f GDPR (legitimate interests)</p>
						
						<h4>What are Cookies?</h4>
						<p>Our website uses HTTP cookies to store user-specific data.<br>
						Below, we explain what cookies are and why they are used to help you better understand the following privacy policy.</p>
						
						<p>Whenever you surf the internet, you use a browser. Common 
						browsers include Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and 
						Microsoft Edge. Most websites save small text files in your browser. 
						These files are called cookies.</p>
						
						<p>One thing is clear: cookies are really useful helpers. Almost
						all websites use cookies. More specifically, these are HTTP cookies, as
						there are also other cookies for different applications. HTTP cookies 
						are small files saved by our website on your computer. These cookie 
						files are automatically placed in the cookie folder, essentially the 
						"brain" of your browser. A cookie consists of a name and a value. 
						Additionally, one or more attributes must be specified when defining a 
						cookie.</p>
						
						<p>Cookies store certain user data, such as language or personal
						page settings. When you return to our site, your browser sends back the
						“user-related” information to our site. Thanks to cookies, our website 
						recognizes who you are and provides you with the settings you are 
						accustomed to. In some browsers, each cookie has its own file; in 
						others, like Firefox, all cookies are stored in a single file.</p>
						
						<p>There are first-party cookies as well as third-party cookies.
						First-party cookies are created directly by our site, while third-party
						cookies are created by partner sites (e.g., Google Analytics). Each 
						cookie must be assessed individually since each one stores different 
						data. The expiration time of a cookie also varies, ranging from a few 
						minutes to several years. Cookies are not software programs and do not 
						contain viruses, Trojans, or other "malware." Cookies also cannot access
						information on your PC.</p>
						
						<p>An example of cookie data might look like this:</p>
						<p><b>Name:</b> _ga<br>
						<b>Value:</b> GA1.2.1326744211.152311891618-9<br>
						<b>Purpose:</b> Differentiating website visitors<br>
						<b>Expiration:</b> After 2 years</p>
						<p>Here are the minimum sizes a browser should be able to support:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>At least 4096 bytes per cookie</li>
							<li>At least 50 cookies per domain</li>
							<li>At least 3000 cookies in total</li>
						</ul>
						
						<h4>Which Types of Cookies Exist?</h4>
						<p>The specific cookies we use depends on the services we 
						utilize, which will be clarified in the following sections of the 
						privacy statement. At this point, we'd like to briefly discuss the 
						different types of HTTP cookies.</p>
							
						<p>There are 4 types of cookies to distinguish:</p>

						<p><b>Essential Cookies</b><br>
						These cookies are necessary to ensure the basic functions of 
						the website. For example, these cookies are needed when a user adds a 
						product to the cart, continues surfing on other pages and only later 
						goes to the checkout. Thanks to these cookies, the cart is not deleted, 
						even if the user closes his browser window.
						<br><br>
						<b>Functional Cookies</b><br>
						These cookies collect information about user behavior and 
						whether the user receives any error messages. Additionally, using these 
						cookies, the loading time and behavior of the website across different 
						browsers is measured.
						<br><br>
						<b>Targeted Cookies</b><br>
						These cookies enhance user-friendliness. For example, entered locations, font sizes, or form data are saved.
						<br><br>
						<b>Advertising Cookies</b><br>
						These cookies are also called targeting cookies. Their purpose
						is to deliver individually tailored advertising to the user. This can 
						be very convenient, but also very annoying.
						</p>
						
						<p>Usually, when visiting a website for the first time, you will
						be asked which of these cookie types you wish to accept. And of course,
						this decision is also stored in a cookie.</p>
						
						<p>If you want to know more about cookies and aren't deterred by technical documentation, we recommend <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265" target="_blank">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265</a>, the Request for Comments by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) called "HTTP State Management Mechanism".</p>
						
						<h4>Purpose of processing via cookies</h4>
						<p>The purpose ultimately depends on the respective cookie. More
						details on this can be found below or from the software manufacturer 
						that sets the cookie.</p>
							
						<h4>What data is processed?</h4>
						<p>Cookies are small assistants for a variety of tasks. It's not
						possible to generalize what data is stored in cookies, but we will 
						inform you about the processed or saved data in the following privacy 
						policy.</p>
							
						<h4>Storage duration of cookies</h4>
						<p>The storage duration depends on the respective cookie and is 
						specified further below. Some cookies are deleted after less than an 
						hour, while others can remain stored on a computer for several years.</p>
						
						<p>You also have influence over the storage duration. You can 
						manually delete all cookies at any time via your browser (see also below
						"Right to object"). Furthermore, cookies that are based on consent are 
						deleted at the latest after you revoke your consent, but the legality of
						the storage remains unaffected until then.</p>
							
						<h4>Right to object - How can I delete cookies?</h4>
						<p>Whether and how you want to use cookies is up to you. 
						Regardless of which service or website the cookies come from, you always
						have the option to delete, deactivate, or only partially allow cookies.
						For example, you can block third-party cookies but allow all other 
						cookies.</p>
						
						<p>If you want to find out which cookies have been stored in 
						your browser, or if you want to change or delete cookie settings, you 
						can find this in your browser settings:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Chrome:</strong> <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delete, enable and manage cookies in Chrome</a></li>
							<li><strong>Safari:</strong> <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/manage-cookies-sfri11471/mac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage cookies and website data with Safari</a></li>
							<li><strong>Firefox:</strong> <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delete cookies to remove data that websites have stored on your computer</a></li>
							<li><strong>Internet Explorer:</strong> <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/delete-and-manage-cookies-168dab11-0753-043d-7c16-ede5947fc64d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delete and manage cookies</a></li>
							<li><strong>Microsoft Edge:</strong> <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/delete-and-manage-cookies-168dab11-0753-043d-7c16-ede5947fc64d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delete and manage cookies</a></li>
						</ul>

						<p>If you fundamentally do not want any cookies, you can set up 
						your browser to always notify you when a cookie is about to be set. This
						way, you can decide for each individual cookie whether you allow it or 
						not. The procedure varies depending on the browser. It's best to search 
						Google with the keyword "delete cookies Chrome" or "disable cookies 
						Chrome" if you are using the Chrome browser.</p>
							
						<h4>Legal basis</h4>
						<p>Since 2009 there have been the so-called "cookie guidelines".
						It states that the storage of cookies requires your consent (Article 6 
						(1) lit. a GDPR). However, there are still very different reactions to 
						these guidelines within EU countries. In Austria, however, this 
						directive was implemented in § 96 para. 3 of the Telecommunications Act 
						(TKG). In Germany, the cookie guidelines were not implemented as 
						national law. Instead, this directive was largely implemented in § 15 
						para.3 of the Telemedia Act (TMG).</p>
							
						<p>For essential cookies, even without consent, there are 
						legitimate interests (Article 6 (1) lit. f GDPR), which in most cases 
						are of an economic nature. We want to offer visitors to the website a 
						pleasant user experience, and for this purpose, certain cookies are 
						often essential.</p>
							
						<p>If cookies that are not absolutely necessary are used, this 
						only happens if you give your consent. The legal basis is, in this case,
						Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.</p>
							
						<p>In the following sections, you will be informed in more 
						detail about the use of cookies, provided that the used software employs
						cookies.</p>
							
						<h4>Web Hosting</h4>
						<p><b>Web Hosting Summary</b><br>
						Affected: Visitors of the website<br>
						Purpose: Professional hosting of the website and securing its operation<br>
						Processed data: IP address, time of website visit, browser 
						used, and other data. More details can be found below or with the 
						respective web hosting provider.<br>
						Storage duration: Depends on the respective provider, but usually 2 weeks<br>
						Legal basis: Art. 6 Para. 1 lit.f GDPR (Legitimate Interests)</p>
						
						<h4>What is Web Hosting?</h4>
						<p>When you visit websites nowadays, certain information - 
						including personal data - is automatically generated and stored, 
						including on this website. This data should be processed as sparingly as
						possible and only with justification. By website, we mean the entirety 
						of all pages on a domain, i.e., everything from the homepage to the very
						last subpage (like this one). By domain, we mean for example 
						beispiel.de or musterbeispiel.com.</p>
						
						<p>If you want to view a website on a screen, you use a program 
						called a web browser. You probably know some web browsers by name: 
						Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari.</p>
						
						<p>This web browser must connect to another computer where the 
						website's code is stored: the web server. Operating a web server is a 
						complex and labor-intensive task, which is why it is usually taken over 
						by professional providers, the hosting companies. They offer web hosting
						and ensure reliable and error-free storage of website data.</p>
						
						<p>When the browser on your computer (desktop, laptop, 
						smartphone) connects and data is transferred to and from the web server,
						personal data can be processed. On the one hand, your computer stores 
						data; on the other hand, the web server also needs to store data for a 
						certain period to ensure smooth operation.</p>
						
						<h4>Why do we process personal data?</h4>
						<p>The purposes of data processing are:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Professional hosting of the website and ensuring its operation</li>
							<li>Maintaining operational and IT security</li>
							<li>Anonymous analysis of user behavior to improve our offer and possibly for law enforcement or to pursue claims</li>
						</ol>
							
						<h4>What data is processed?</h4>
						<p>Even as you visit our website right now, our web server, the 
						computer where this web page is stored, usually automatically saves data
						such as:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li>the complete internet address (URL) of the accessed 
								website (e.g., 
								https://www.samplewebsite.com/samplesubpage.html?tid=311891618)</li>
							<li>Browser and browser version (e.g., Chrome 87)</li>
							<li>the operating system used (e.g., Windows 10)</li>
							<li>the address (URL) of the previously visited page (referrer URL) (e.g., https://www.examplesourcesite.com/fromwhereicame.html/)</li>
							<li>the hostname and the IP address of the device accessing (e.g., COMPUTERNAME and 194.23.43.121)</li>
							<li>Date and time</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>This data is stored in files called web server log files.</p>
						
						<h4>How long is data stored?</h4>
						<p>As a rule, the data mentioned above is stored for two weeks 
						and then automatically deleted. We do not share this data, but we cannot
						exclude the possibility that this data may be viewed by authorities in 
						the event of illegal behavior.</p>
							
						<p>In short: Your visit is logged by our provider (the company 
						that runs our website on specialized computers (servers)), but we do not
						share your data without your consent!</p>
							
						<h4>Legal Basis</h4>
						<p>The legality of processing personal data as part of web 
						hosting is derived from Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR (Protection of 
						legitimate interests), as using professional hosting with a provider is 
						necessary to present the company securely and user-friendly on the 
						internet and to be able to pursue attacks and claims arising from it if 
						necessary.</p>
							
						<p>There is usually a contract between us and the hosting 
						provider for order processing according to Art. 28 f. GDPR, which 
						ensures compliance with data protection and guarantees data security.</p>

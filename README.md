# HERALD - Demo

## About HERALD

HERALD stands for Human-centric Extraction for Research and Analysis of Longitudinal Data. It is a specialized query language designed to facilitate the extraction and aggregation of longitudinal data into cross-sectional tables for statistical analysis and machine learning. The design of HERALD's syntax is intuitive, closely mirroring natural language. The prototype implementation consists of a query excecution engine, combined with a graphical query editor, and a web demo with analytics functionalities. 

This repository contains the code of the demo accessible at [herald-lang.org](http://herald-lang.org). It uses bundled versions of the basic modules of HERALD hosted at [herald-lang](https://github.com/BIH-MI/herald-lang), together with the implementation of the demo.

## About the demo

Access the online demonstration at [herald-lang.org](http://herald-lang.org). The demo contains three examples, that are based on subsets of the synthetically generated patient records from the [Synthea SyntheticMass dataset](https://synthea.mitre.org/downloads).

To deploy it locally, simply download the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

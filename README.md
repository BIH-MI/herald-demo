# HERALD - Demo

## About HERALD

HERALD stands for Human-centric Extraction for Research and Analysis of Longitudinal Data. It is a specialized query language designed to empower medical researchers in analyzing longitudinal health data. The core aim of HERALD Lang is to facilitate the extraction and aggregation of data into cross-sectional tables for statistical analyses. The design of HERALD's syntax is intuitive, closely mirroring natural language to enhance user accessibility and efficiency. The prototype implementation consists of a HERALD excecution engine, combined with a  graphical query editor, and paired with analytics functionalities to showcase the capabilities of the HERALD query language. 

This repository houses the code for a live demonstration accessible at [herald-lang.org](http://herald-lang.org). It encapsulates bundled versions of the basic functionalities of HERALD hosted in [herald-lang](https://github.com/BIH-MI/herald-lang), together with specific code for the live demo. The demo showcases HERALD's capabilities through a web-based user interface, simplifying the query building process for users through features such as query construction dialogs and concept hierarchy browsing.

## Exploring the demo

Access the live demonstration at [herald-lang.org](http://herald-lang.org). The web page will guide you through the live demo, showcasing HERALD's application on three distinct example datasets, that are based on subsets of the synthetically generated patient records from the [Synthea SyntheticMass dataset](https://synthea.mitre.org/downloads).

To deploy it locally, simply download the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser.
